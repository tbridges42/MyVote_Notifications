Clerk Notifications New Online Absentee Applications

You are receiving this message because a voter in your municipality requested an absentee ballot through MyVote.wi.gov.

While we transition to the WisVote system, the notifications you see from MyVote will look a little different for the next few weeks.

Please take a look at the attached spreadsheet and identify the voters in your municipality who have requested a ballot.  Remember, their absentee ballot request will also be waiting for you in WisVote as a pending absentee ballot application.  This email is just a reminder.

Also, as a reminder, please pay particular attention to how your voter wishes to receive their absentee ballot.  You will find this information in the “Ballot Delivery Method” column.  Military and Overseas voters can request to receive their ballots by mail, email, fax, or online through MyVote.wi.gov.


If the voter would like to receive their ballot by mail:
•	You must mail out these absentee ballots.




If the voter would like to receive their ballot by fax:
•	You must fax out these absentee ballots.




If the voter would like to receive their ballot by email:
•	You must email out these absentee ballots.




If the voter would like to receive their ballot online:
	•	These ballots will be sent out automatically through MyVote.  You do not need to take any action at this time. The My Vote WI site will automatically email the voter when their absentee ballots are available.

Please call or email the G.A.B. at GABHelpDesk@wi.gov or (608) 261-2028 if you have any questions.
